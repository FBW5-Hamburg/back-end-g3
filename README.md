# back-end-g3

This project is about to connect the Frontend with the Backend. 
It's about to use, store and recall Data from the Database. 

We will work with Node.js / Express and with MongoDb as the Database to accomplish this task. 
The Design is secondary in this project.

We have chosen to connect a multiple choice test / quiz with the database. 
The actions we want to realize are : 

Participants can register/log in and take the test. 
Their username and password will be stored to be able to login in again.
Their Scores will be saved and either shown to them or send to them via mail.
The Admin can log in on his/her own panel and either add, edit or delete the questions, answer choices and the correct answer. 


We are using following dependencies : 

*npm 
*express
*ejs
*password-hash
*nodemailer
*mongoose


We are :
